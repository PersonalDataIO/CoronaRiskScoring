# CoronaRiskScoring

This is an effort to have a broad and comparative discussion around risk scoring algorithms in Bluetooth based corona-tracking apps, highlighting subtle nuances in their conception and parametrization.

# How to contribute?

* expand the list above
* contribute an issue describing your understanding of how risk scoring works in the app

Please consider:
* Android vs iOS
* Bluetooth ranging (is there an explicit step to produce a distance measurement?)
* How is risk calculated from a distance measurement?
* How transparent the app is about the whole process?
* see also [#2](https://github.com/PersonalDataIO/CoronaRiskScoring/issues/2)
* ...

# How to assist?
If you have experience contributing to or setting up a project such as this one, please provide suggestions on how to improve (for instance which features should we use?)
